		In this article costs are compared between DD-PMG, SG-PMG and DFIG.
		O&M costs for DFIG are the highest compared to its alternatives. Have made a factor \
		based on the difference of O&M costs of offshore turbines from 10 km away \
		from shore (source below). In this factor the O&M costs for DFIG are 1, \
		DD-PMG are 0.46 (from 7.94/17.27) and SG-PMG are 0.77 (from 13.27/17.27). 
		O&M costs for SCIG & EESG are assumed to be similar to DFIG, O&M costs for \
		HTS are assumed to be similar to PMG DD.

		There was no data on EESG, SCIG and HTS. For HTS it is assumed that the costs will \
		be similar to PMG DD.
		For the wind turbines that utilize gearboxes (EESG, DFIG & SCIG), the scheduled \
		maintenance cost is higher because they have more moving parts (gearbox) \
		and wear points and more maintenance is needed. 
		So the maintenance cost of wind turbines with gearboxes is higher. It is \
