		There was no data on EESG, SCIG and HTS. For HTS it is assumed that the costs will \

		For the wind turbines that utilize gearboxes (EESG, DFIG & SCIG), the scheduled \
		maintenance cost is higher because they have more moving parts (gearbox) \
		and wear points and more maintenance is needed. 
		So the maintenance cost of wind turbines with gearboxes is higher. It is \
